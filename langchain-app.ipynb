    "# Fashion Recommendation RAG System\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a LangChain-powered RAG system for fashion recommendations using fine-tuned CLIP embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Given a natural-language query (e.g., 'What would look good on a brunch date?'), the system:\n",
    "1. Embeds the query using our fine-tuned CLIP model\n",
    "2. Retrieves top-k fashion items from ChromaDB vector database  \n",
    "3. Uses LangChain to generate personalized fashion advice\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB with fashion product embeddings and metadata\n",
    "- **Retriever**: Custom fashion product retriever with metadata filtering\n",
    "- **LLM**: GPT-4.1-mini for generating fashion advice\n",
    "- **State Management**: LangGraph for handling query processing workflow"

      " Recommendation:\n",
      "For a traditional South Indian marriage ceremony, the attire should be deeply rooted in ethnic elegance, reflecting rich cultural aesthetics often characterized by vibrant colors, intricate designs, and classic draping styles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the retrieved products, here is a curated recommendation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Saree Selection:**  \n",
      "   The **FNF Green Collection for Wedding Sari** stands out as an excellent choice. Green is a auspicious color in South Indian weddings, symbolizing prosperity and new beginnings. Since this sari is specifically for weddings and designed for ethnic use, it likely features traditional weaving or embellishments that align well with South Indian bridal or ceremonial wear. The fall season mention indicates it has rich, warm tones and possibly heavier fabric, which is appropriate for grand wedding events.  \n",
      "   \n",
      "   Alternatively, the **FNF Maroon Printed Wedding Collection Sari** is a strong contender. Maroon (or deep red) is quintessential in South Indian weddings, often worn by the bride or close family members. This color adds a regal and traditional vibe.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Styling Tips:**  \n",
      "   - Pair the green or maroon sari with traditional temple jewelry — gold necklaces, jhumkas (earrings), bangles, and a classic maang tikka or hair accessories like flowers (jasmine garlands).  \n",
      "   - Wear your hair in a traditional braid adorned with flowers to enhance the ethnic appeal.  \n",
      "   - Opt for a blouse with intricate embroidery or gold zari work to complement the sari.  \n",
      "   - Footwear should be elegant and comfortable, such as embellished sandals or mojaris, suitable for long ceremonies.  \n",
      "   \n",
      "3. **Additional Styling Notes:**  \n",
      "   - Since this is a South Indian wedding, draping the saree in the traditional South Indian style (Madisar or other regional variations) will maintain authenticity.  \n",
      "   - Use colors and designs that complement the wedding’s traditional vibe; heavy fabrics like silk or brocade are highly recommended, as they reflect the celebratory tone and photograph beautifully.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **What to Avoid:**  \n",
      "   - Lighter pastel colors or casual ethnic wear like kurtas which may not convey the grandeur of a wedding occasion.  \n",
      "   - Overly modern cuts or westernized styles that might detract from the traditional essence.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:**  \n",
      "Recommend dressing your sister in the **FNF Green Wedding Sari** for an auspicious, culturally rich look, or the **FNF Maroon Wedding Sari** for a classic, regal presence. Both will provide vibrant, ethnic elegance suitable for a South Indian traditional marriage ceremony when accessorized with classic gold temple jewelry and traditional hair styling. This approach ensures she stands out beautifully, honoring the occasion’s deep-rooted customs.\n",

Since this sari is specifically for weddings and designed for ethnic use, it likely features traditional weaving or embellishments that align well with South Indian bridal or ceremonial wear. The fall season mention indicates it has rich, warm tones and possibly heavier fabric, which is appropriate for grand wedding events.  \n",
      "   \n",
      "   Alternatively, the **FNF Maroon Printed Wedding Collection Sari** is a strong contender. Maroon (or deep red) is quintessential in South Indian weddings, often worn by the bride or close family members. This color adds a regal and traditional vibe.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Styling Tips:**  \n",
      "   - Pair the green or maroon sari with traditional temple jewelry — gold necklaces, jhumkas (earrings), bangles, and a classic maang tikka or hair accessories like flowers (jasmine garlands).  \n",
      "   - Wear your hair in a traditional braid adorned with flowers to enhance the ethnic appeal.  \n",
      "   - Opt for a blouse with intricate embroidery or gold zari work to complement the sari.  \n",
      "   - Footwear should be elegant and comfortable, such as embellished sandals or mojaris, suitable for long ceremonies.  \n",
      "   \n",
      "3. **Additional Styling Notes:**  \n",
      "   - Since this is a South Indian wedding, draping the saree in the traditional South Indian style (Madisar or other regional variations) will maintain authenticity.  \n",
      "   - Use colors and designs that complement the wedding’s traditional vibe; heavy fabrics like silk or brocade are highly recommended, as they reflect the celebratory tone and photograph beautifully.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **What to Avoid:**  \n",
      "   - Lighter pastel colors or casual ethnic wear like kurtas which may not convey the grandeur of a wedding occasion.  \n",
      "   - Overly modern cuts or westernized styles that might detract from the traditional essence.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:**  \n",
      "Recommend dressing your sister in the **FNF Green Wedding Sari** for an auspicious, culturally rich look, or the **FNF Maroon Wedding Sari** for a classic, regal presence. Both will provide vibrant, ethnic elegance suitable for a South Indian traditional marriage ceremony when accessorized with classic gold temple jewelry and traditional hair styling. This approach ensures she stands out beautifully, honoring the occasion’s deep-rooted customs.\n",

      " Recommendation:\n",
      "For a professional business meeting, especially with a preference for formal women's apparel, the key is to balance a polished, authoritative look with comfort and confidence. Here’s a detailed recommendation to help you dress appropriately:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Tailored Blazer and Trousers or Skirt:\n",
      "- Choose a well-fitted blazer in a neutral color such as navy, black, charcoal, or deep gray. These colors convey professionalism and are versatile.\n",
      "- Pair this blazer with matching tailored trousers or a pencil skirt. The skirt should be knee-length for a conservative look.\n",
      "- Look for structured fabrics like wool blends or high-quality polyester that maintain shape throughout the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Blouse or Shirt:\n",
      "- Under the blazer, wear a crisp button-down shirt or a silk blouse in white, light blue, or soft pastels. Avoid overly bright or neon colors.\n",
      "- A modest neckline (like a crew neck or modest V-neck) ensures a professional appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Shoes:\n",
      "- Opt for closed-toe pumps or low-heeled shoes in black, navy, or nude. Comfort is key since business meetings can sometimes be lengthy.\n",
      "- Avoid overly high heels or trendy designs.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Accessories:\n",
      "- Keep accessories minimal and elegant. Simple stud earrings, a classic wristwatch, and a structured handbag work well.\n",
      "- Avoid large statement jewelry or anything too flashy.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Hair and Makeup:\n",
      "- Style your hair neatly, whether you prefer it down or in a low bun or ponytail.\n",
      "- Makeup should be natural and polished – think neutral tones and subtle lip color.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Optional Outerwear:\n",
      "- If appropriate, a tailored trench coat or professional-looking overcoat will complement this look, especially in cooler seasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why This Works:\n",
      "- The tailored suit sets a formal tone required for business meetings, signaling professionalism and confidence.\n",
      "- Neutral color palettes are universally accepted in corporate environments and make mixing and matching easier.\n",
      "- The fit and fabric choice ensure you look sharp and feel comfortable throughout the meeting.\n",
      "- Minimal accessories avoid distractions and maintain focus on your professionalism and communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have specific brands or stores you prefer, I can help suggest suitable options that align with this classic, formal business attire.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Top:** Opt for the French Connection Men Black Check Shirt (#7). The check pattern adds visual interest without being too loud, making it perfect for casual outings. The black base is versatile and works well for day wear, and since it’s a summer shirt, it will keep you comfortable and breathable while shopping.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Bottom:** Pair this with the Spykar Men Blue Jeans (#3). Blue jeans are a classic casual staple and offer durability and comfort, ideal for walking around malls or markets. The blue tone will nicely complement the black check shirt, creating a balanced look that isn't overly monochrome.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Footwear and Accessories:** Although not listed, I recommend choosing casual sneakers or loafers in neutral shades like white, black, or grey to match this ensemble effortlessly. A casual watch or a simple bracelet can add subtle style without overdoing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Additional Styling Notes:** Roll up the shirt sleeves for a more relaxed weekend vibe. If the weather is sunny, consider a pair of stylish sunglasses to complete your look.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why this works:** The black check shirt combined with classic blue jeans strikes the perfect casual tone—neither too formal nor too laid-back. The summer-season clothing ensures comfort in warm weather, while the mix of patterns and solid hues adds style depth. This combination is practical for a shopping trip, allowing you to move freely while staying fashionable.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you prefer shorts over jeans for extra comfort or hotter weather, you could swap the jeans with Myntra Men Blue Check Shorts (#2). Pairing them with a casual solid-light t-shirt or leaving the black check shirt untucked over a plain tee would maintain the casual aesthetic.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the black check shirt and blue jeans combo is my top recommendation for a casual, stylish, and comfortable weekend shopping look.\n",
